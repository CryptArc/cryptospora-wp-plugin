        <p>Diaspora in Wordpress (W*) is a PHP based Diaspora Pod implementation, based on Wordpress. Technically it is a plugin (or set of plugins) which adds Diaspora Pod functionality to your Wordpress blog.</p>

<p>Why are we building it?</p>

<p>Diaspora is a new way of social networking. It is decentralized, and everybody can own his/her own data. Diaspora is built on 'Ruby on Rails', which is a nice framework, but I think, the world needs a PHP based solution. (It is easier to find a hosting provider, and many people are more familiar to PHP than Ruby.)</p>

<p>Why is it built on Wordpress?</p>

<p>Wordpress is one of the most popular web frameworks of the world. Many people use and like it. Wordpress has a good posting, user management and plugin system, which is a perfect base for a Diaspora Pod.</p>

<p>License.</p>

<p>The project will be available on GitHub licensed under the GPL. Everybody can use it, fork it, extend it directly or through the Wordpress plugin system.</p>
